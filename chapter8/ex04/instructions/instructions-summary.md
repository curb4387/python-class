## Your Tasks

The twentieth-century Dutch artist Piet Mondrian developed a style of abstract painting that exhibited simple recursive patterns. To generate such a pattern with a computer, one would begin with a filled rectangle in a random color and then repeatedly fill two unequal subdivisions with random colors, as shown in _Figure 8-16_. (LO: 8.1)

<sup>_Figure 8-16_</sup>

As you can see, the algorithm continues the process of subdivision until an “aesthetically right moment” is reached. In this version, the algorithm divides the current rectangle into portions representing one-third and two-thirds of its area and alternates these subdivisions along the horizontal and vertical axes. Design, implement, and test a script (in the file **mondrian.py**) that uses a recursive function to draw these patterns
