## Your Tasks

Profile the performance of the memoized version of the Fibonacci function defined in _Programming Exercise 6_. The function (in the file **fib.py**) should accept a `Counter` object as an argument and count the number of recursive calls. State its computational complexity using big-O notation and justify your answer. (LO: 13.1, 13.2, 13.6)
