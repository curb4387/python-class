## Your Tasks

A computer supports the calls of recursive functions using a structure called the call stack. Generally speaking, the computer reserves a constant amount of memory for each call of a function. Thus, the memory used by a recursive function can be subjected to complexity analysis. State the computational complexity of the memory used by the recursive factorial and Fibonacci functions, as defined in Chapter 7. (LO: 13.2, 13.6)
