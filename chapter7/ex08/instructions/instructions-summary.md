## Your Tasks

Suppose that Python does not include the higher-order functions map, filter, and reduce. Define three corresponding functions, named `myMap`, `myFilter`, and `myReduce`, in a new module named `hof` (in the file **hof.py**). The `myMap` and `myFilter` functions expect a function of one argument and a list as arguments and return a list of the results. The `myReduce` function expects a function of two arguments and a nonempty list as arguments and returns a single value. Test your functions in a short tester program (in the file **testhof.py**) that compares their behavior to that of Pythonâ€™s own map, filter, and reduce functions. (LO: 7.2)
