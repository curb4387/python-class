## Your Tasks

Restructure Newtonâ€™s method (Case Study 3-2: Approximating Square Roots, Chapter 3) by decomposing it into three cooperating functions. The `newton` function should use the recursive strategy of _Programming Exercise 7.1_ (in the file **newton.py**). The task of testing for the limit is assigned to a function named `limitReached`, whereas the task of computing a new approximation is assigned to a function named `improveEstimate`. Each function expects the relevant arguments and returns an appropriate value. (LO: 7.1)
