## Your Tasks

Jack is developing a program that calls for converting a list of words to uppercase. He tries out a strategy for this task in the Python shell, as follows:

```python
listOfWords = ["Apple", "orange", "banana"]
for word in listOfWords:
    word = word.upper()
print(listOfWords)
```

```txt
['Apple', 'orange', 'banana']
```

Jackâ€™s strategy does not appear to produce the expected result. Determine the error and correct it.
