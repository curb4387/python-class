## Your Tasks

Conversations often shift focus to earlier topics. Modify the therapist program in the file **doctor.py** to support this capability. Add each patient input to a history list. Then occasionally choose an element at random from this list, change persons, and prepend (add at the beginning) the qualifier “Earlier you said that” to this reply. Make sure that this option is triggered only after several exchanges have occurred. (LO: 5.1, 5.2)
