## Your Tasks

Jack is testing the Student class developed earlier in this chapter. He creates an instance of this class with 0 scores and receives an error message when he attempts to view the average score:

```python
>>> s = Student("Jack", 0)
>>> print(s)
Name: Jack
Scores:
>>> s.getAverageScoreScore()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<pyshell#8>", line 1, in <module>
    s.getAverageScore()
  File "/Users/ken/pythonfiles/student.py", line 42, in getAverageScoreScore
    return sum(self.scores) / len(self.scores)
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

Explain the error detected during this test and prevent it from happening.
