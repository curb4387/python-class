## Your Tasks

This project assumes that you have completed Project 1. Place several `Student` objects into a list and `shuffle` it. Then run the `sort` method with this list and display all of the studentsâ€™ information. Print to the console the unsorted list first of all students followed by the sorted list of all students

Note: The sorted list should output in the following format:

```
Sorted list of students:
Name: Name1
Scores: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Name: Name2
Scores: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Name: Name3
Scores: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Name: Name4
Scores: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Name: Name5
Scores: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

> Hint: Use the `print` function with a `Student` object as an argument to print the `Student` object in the format specified above.
