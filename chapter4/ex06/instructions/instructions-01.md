**Task 1**:  Use the strategy of the decimal to binary conversion and the bit shift left operation defined in Programming Exercise 5 to code a new encryption algorithm in the file **encrypt.py**. The algorithm should add 1 to each characterâ€™s numeric ASCII value, convert it to a bit string, and shift the bits of this string one place to the left. A single-space character in the encrypted string separates the resulting bit strings. (LO: 4.1, 4.4)
