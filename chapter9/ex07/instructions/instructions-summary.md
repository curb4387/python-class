## Your Tasks

The TidBit Computer Store (_Chapter 3, Programming Exercise 10_) has a credit plan for computer purchases. Inputs are the annual interest rate and the purchase price. Monthly payments are 5% of the listed purchase price, minus the down payment, which must be 10% of the purchase price. Write a GUI-based program in the file **tidbitwithgui.py** that displays labeled fields for the inputs and a text area for the output. The program should display a table, with appropriate headers, of a payment schedule for the lifetime of the loan. Each row of the table should contain the following items:

- The month number (beginning with 1)
- The current total balance owed
- The interest owed for that month
- The amount of principal owed for that month
- The payment for that month
- The balance remaining after payment
