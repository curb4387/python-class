## Your Tasks

Write a GUI-based program in the file **imagebrowser.py** that implements an image browser for your computerâ€™s file system. The look, feel, and program logic should be like those of the simple text file browser developed in this chapter. The file dialog should filter for GIF image files and create and open a PhotoImage when a file is accessed. (LO: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.6, 9.7)
