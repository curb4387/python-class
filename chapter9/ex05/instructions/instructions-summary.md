## Your Tasks

Write a GUI-based program in the file **guesswithgui.py** that plays a guess-the-number game in which the roles of the computer and the user are the reverse of what they are in the Case Study of this chapter. In this version of
the game, the computer guesses a number between 1 and 100 and the user provides the responses. The window should display the computerâ€™s guesses with a label. The user enters a hint in response, by selecting one of a set of command buttons labeled Too small, Too large, and Correct. When the game is over, you should disable these buttons and wait for the user to click New game, as before. (LO: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 9.7)
