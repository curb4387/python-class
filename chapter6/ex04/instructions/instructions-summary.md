## Your Tasks

Modify the grammar checker of this chapter’s Case Study, in the file **recognizer.py**, so that it recognizes the following additional types of variations in phrases:

- A verb phrase with no prepositional phrase (example: “The boy saw the girl”).
- A noun phrase in which the noun is modified by an adjective (example: “The girl hit the red ball with a bat”).
- A sentence that connects two independent clauses with a conjunction (example: “The boy saw the girl and the girl hit the red ball with a bat”).

You should add new variables for the sets of adjectives and conjunctions. (LO: 6.2)
