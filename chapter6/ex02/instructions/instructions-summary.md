## Your Tasks

Restructure Newtonâ€™s method (_Case Study 3-2_) by decomposing it into three cooperating functions (including the original `newton` method.). The task of testing for the limit is assigned to a function named `limitReached`, whereas the task of computing a new approximation is assigned to a function named `improveEstimate`. Each function, in the file named **newton.py**, expects the relevant arguments and returns an appropriate value. (LO: 6.2)

Required methods to implement for this exercise:
```
    newton(x): Returns the square root of x
    improveEstimate(x, estimate): Returns the new estimate by using the formula (estimate + x / estimate) / 2
    limitReached(x, estimate): Returns True if the differences is less than or equal to the global TOLERANCE variable, else False
```
