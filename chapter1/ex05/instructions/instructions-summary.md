## Your Tasks

A cuboid is a solid figure bounded by six rectangular faces. Its dimensions are its height, width, and depth. Write a Python program in **cuboid.py** that computes and prints the volume of a cuboid, given its height, width, and depth as inputs. The volume is just the product of these three inputs. The output should be labeled as “cubic units.” (LO: 1.4)
