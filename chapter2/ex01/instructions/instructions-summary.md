## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.
