## Your Tasks

For this exercise, write a program that contains an introductory docstring. This documentation should describe what the program will do (analysis) and how it will do it (design the program in the form of a pseudocode algorithm). Include suitable prompts for all inputs, and label all outputs appropriately. After you have coded a program, be sure to test it with a reasonable set of legitimate inputs.

## Instructions

For this exercise, use the following approximations:

- A kilometer represents 1/10,000 of the distance between the North Pole and the equator.
- There are 90 degrees, containing 60 minutes of arc each, between the North Pole and the equator.
- A nautical mile is 1 minute of an arc. (LO: 2.4)
